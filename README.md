## Features

- Responsive layout that adjusts to different screen sizes.
- Interactive elements with hover and focus states for improved user experience.

## My Approach

I approached this challenge by first analyzing the design and breaking it down into smaller components. I then used semantic HTML5 markup to structure the content and employed CSS custom properties for easy styling. Flexbox was my go-to choice for creating the responsive layout while ensuring optimal alignment and positioning of elements.
Used Javscript to add in the event listeners for effectively changing the seleced rating's score and keep track of the rating to display on the Thank You card.

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3 (Flexbox and CSS Grid)
- Javascript
